  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>E.Motion is the only exclusively K-Pop dance cover group on campus. We teach anyone who is interested, whether they
    have dance experience or not, and prepare them for performances. To encourage everyone to dance with us, we provide
    varying levels of participation ranging from no-audition group dances and workshops to audition-only performance teams
    for the selected dances of the semester.</p>
  <p>We have had the privilege to perform at many Cornell events, KCON NY for the
    past two years, and have won a global dance cover contest from 1theK! We've covered groups such as SNSD, BTS, Twice,
    Big Bang, SISTAR, and many more!</p>
